# heart_disease_classificaton
This project aims to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on a set of medical features. The model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data and provide a reliable diagnosis.
FEATURES
Machine Learning Models: The project employs popular machine learning algorithms (e.g. Random Forests) to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
Evaluation Metrics: The modelâ€™s performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, ensuring a robust evaluation of its predictive power.
PROJECT OVERVIEW
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and preprocessing steps are carried out to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Relevant features are selected and engineered to improve model performance.
Model Training: Various classification models are trained on the dataset and fine-tuned to enhance prediction accuracy.
Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using cross-validation, ensuring generalization to unseen data.
